  <h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
  
1. Configured R1's hostname

2. Used a 'show' command to view a list of R1's interfaces, their IP addresses, status, etc.

3. Configured the appropriate IP addresses on R1's interfaces, and enable the interfaces
    Configured appropriate interface descriptions

4. Used a 'show' command to verify R1's interfaces again.

5. Viewed the running config to confirm the configuration changes, then saved the config

6. Configured the IP addresses of PC1, PC2, and PC3
   
7. Pinged from PC1 to PC2 and PC3 to test connectivity
